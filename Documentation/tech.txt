  "Elaborazione foglio presenze"

 

Deveoped and customized by Guido De Rosa <guidoderosa@gmail.com>
for A.T.P. srl, Tito, PZ, ITALY

A Perl program to estract informations from pdf reports generatìed by
"Selesta Ingegneria"'s PresWeb(R) and put them in MS Excel stylesheets
according to A.T.P.'s specifications. 

In the program directory you will find

* pdf2xls.pl main Perl script
* pdf2xls.exe the above script "compiled" through PAR::Packer (pp)
* A Microsoft Excel template file (*.xlt)
* default configuration files festivi.conf, esclusi.conf; at first run
  they are copied into a subdir of %APPDATA% if that environment variable
  is set: this is useful on a multi-user environment, where an unprivileged
  user is unauthorized to write inside %PROGRAMFILES% subdirectories.
* a latsfile.dat; a datafile containing the path to the last (pdf) file opened; 
  same considerations on multiuser environment hold.
* pdf2text.exe from Xpdf project (sources included).

festivi.conf holidays in MMDD or YYMMDD formats.
 

----------------------------------------------------------------


      Software requirements:
 

· *pdftotext* from Xpdf 3.01 is already included.
  DO NOT USE OTHER VERSIONS.

· *ActivePerl* ( http://www.ActiveState.com/ActivePerl/ ). Raccomended
  version is 5.8 (and maybe >5.8; it may work with 5.6 too, not tested...)
  * includes 'Perl Package Manager'

· *Microsoft Excel* (Microsoft Office). 2000 and 2003 Pro versions tested.

· Windows OS. Program tested on XP Pro, it may work in othe Windows versions
  but I didn't tested.

· Perl Modules not included with ActivePerl (with repositories for your 'Perl Package Manager')
  * Win32::WebBrowser         http://www.bribes.org/perl/ppm/
  * PAR::Packer               http://theoryx5.uwinnipeg.ca/ppms/package.xml (to build an .exe with 'pp')

 
     
******   Building an .exe ****************

Usually, pp's path is something like C:\Perl\site\bin\pp.(exe|bat|...)

You may add [PERL INSTALL DIR]\site\bin to your PATH.


>   pp -o pdf2xls.exe pdf2xls.pl

test the executable

>   pdf2xls.exe

If it complains about missing modules use -M Missing::Module; when all is ok,
build an executable without that horrible useless terminal window appearing
when user "clicks" on the exe itself (i.e. embed wperl interpreter instead
of perl)

>   pp -g -o pdf2xls.exe pdf2xls.pl

Your pdf2xls.exe is ready now; it doesn't need Active perl on the target machine, 
but it still needs pdftotext.exe, *.conf, and lastfile.dat; Obviously, Documentaion
Directory has to be included in your distribution; Xpdf sources are technically 
optional.
